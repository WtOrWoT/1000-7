    <date>8.07.24</date>
    <ul>
      <li>The anthem is ready!</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
      <li>Anthem text:
          In the star arena, everyone is fighting,
KOOLyras is my choice, it is as strong as steel.
My anthem is like fire, there is no deception in it,
I am unstoppable, I am the king of the battlefield.

Battle on the beat, like an epic film,
My anthem sounds menacing, powerful as a sword.
KOOLyras in the heart, it is in it, it is everywhere,
We will conquer this world and leave on other winds.

There will be dust, smoke, there will be pain and tears,
But our KOOLyras will always be with us in battle.
You can't stop us, we are like a chipmunk in a wheel,
Only forward, only forward, we are going to meet fate.

This is the anthem of triumph, victory and light,
KOOLyras is our answer in the battle for freedom.
It is in our hearts, it is in our blood,
We will show the world that a real anthem is our right!</li>
